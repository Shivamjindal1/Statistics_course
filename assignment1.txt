Ans. 1)
a) both the dice show the same number
11  , 22 , 33 , 44 , 55 , 66
Probability = 6/36 = 1/6

b) the first die shows 6.
(6 , 1) (6 , 2) (6 , 3)( 6. 4)(6 , 5) (6 , 6)
Probability = 6/36 = 1/6

c) the total of the numbers on the dice is 8
2 + 6 = 8  , 3 + 5 = 8  , 4 + 4 = 8 , 5 + 3 = 8  6 + 2 = 8
Probability = 5/36

d) the total of the numbers on the dice is greater than 8.
Total 9 , 10 , 11 , 12
36  , 45 , 46 , 54 , 55 , 56  , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66
Probability = 10/36 = 5/18

e) the total of the numbers on the dice is 13
maximum sum possible = 12 (6 + 6)
Probability = 0,
the total of the numbers on the dice is any number from 2 and 12, both inclusive
Sum will lies between  2  To 12 only
Hence probability = 1



Ans. 2)
a) The probability of 1st card is a king is 4/52, the probability of the second card is a queen is 4/51, jack – 4/50, ace – 4/49. This is 4 independent events, and the probability of their occasion at the same time is a product of values above: 
P=(4*4*4*4)/(52*51*50*49)=0.0000394

b) The probability of two kings and two queen is equal to
P=(4*3*4*3)/(52*51*50*49)=0.000022

c) The probability of drawing 2 black cards is equal to: 
(26*25)/(52*51)
The probability of drawing 2 red cards after first and second were red is equal to:
(26*25)/(50*49)
 The probability of 2 red and 2 blacks:
P=(26*25*26*25)/(52*51*50*49)=0.065

d) The probability of 2 hearts  is: 
(13*12)/(52*51)
The probability of 2 diamonds after first and second were hearts  is:
(13*12)/(50*49)
The probability of 2 hearts  and 2 diamonds is:
P=(13*12*13*12)/( 52*51*50*49)=0.00374


Ans. 3)
a)Number of ways (m) in which out of 3 balls drawn, 2 are white and the remaining one is non- 
White is 6C2*13C*1=195
Total number of ways 3 balls can be drawn from this box is 13C3=969
Hence, required probability is :
P=195/969=65/323
b)  P=One of each colour is:
P = (6*4*9)/(19*18*17)=0.37

c) Out of 19 balls 4 are red and 15 are not
P = 15C3/969=455/969

d) P(at least one white)=1-P(no white)
P=1-13C3/969=1-286/969=683/969


Ans. 4)
a)P(X)=6/8+6=6/14
P(X`)=1-P(X)=8/14
P(Y)=14/14+16=14/30
P(Y`)=1-P(Y)=16/30
P(neither solves the problem)=P(X` [union] Y`)= P(X`) . P(Y`)=32/105

b)Probability dispute settled by X=6/14
Probability dispute settled by Y=14/30


Ans. 5)
For person X:
The odds of speaking the truth are 3:2.
The probability of speaking the truth = 3 / (3 + 2) = 3/5.
The probability of lying = 1 - (3/5) = 2/5.
For person Y:
The odds of speaking the truth are 5:3.
The probability of speaking the truth = 5 / (5 + 3) = 5/8.
The probability of lying = 1 - (5/8) = 3/8.
Now, let's calculate the probability that person X speaks the truth while person Y lies and vice versa. These are the cases in which they contradict each other.
X speaks truth, Y speaks a lie: Probability(X speaks truth) * Probability(Y speaks a lie) = (3/5) * (3/8) = 9/40.
X speaks a lie, Y speaks truth: Probability(X speaks a lie) * Probability(Y speaks truth) = (2/5) * (5/8) = 10/40.
Now, add these two probabilities together to get the total probability of them contradicting each other:
Total Probability of Contradiction = (9/40) + (10/40) = 19/40.


Ans. 6)
Let's find the probability that the problem will not be solved by any of the students (i.e., all three fail), and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that it will be solved.
The probability that student A fails to solve the problem is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The probability that student B fails to solve the problem is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. The probability that student C fails to solve the problem is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.
Since the students try independently, the probability that all three fail is the product of their individual failure probabilities:
Probability(all three fail) = (1/2) * (1/4) * (3/4) = (1/2) * (3/16) = 3/32.
Now, to find the probability that the problem will be solved, we subtract this probability from 1:
Probability(problem is solved) = 1 - Probability(all three fail) = 1 - 3/32 = 32/32 - 3/32 = 29/32.
So, the probability that the problem will be solved if all three students try independently is 29/32.


Ans. 7)
Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:
a) Probability of picking an unemployed female:
Since there are equal numbers of males and females, half of the population is female.
Probability of picking an unemployed person who is female = (Probability of being female) * (Probability of being unemployed | female)
Probability of being female = 1/2 (since there are equal numbers of males and females).
Probability of being unemployed | female = 20% = 0.20 (since 20% of females are unemployed).
Now, calculate the probability:
Probability(unemployed female) = (1/2) * 0.20 = 0.10.
So, the probability of picking an unemployed person who is female is 0.10 or 10%.
b) Probability of picking an unemployed male:
Probability of picking an unemployed person who is male = (Probability of being male) * (Probability of being unemployed | male)
Probability of being male = 1/2 (since there are equal numbers of males and females).
Probability of being unemployed | male = 5% = 0.05 (since 5% of males are unemployed).
Now, calculate the probability:
Probability(unemployed male) = (1/2) * 0.05 = 0.025.
So, the probability of picking an unemployed person who is male is 0.025 or 2.5%.
To summarize: a) Probability of picking an unemployed female is 10%. b) Probability of picking an unemployed male is 2.5%.
